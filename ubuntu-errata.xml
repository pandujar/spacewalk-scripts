This could allow a remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should not be permitted. (CVE-2011-3377)  Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view confidential data. (CVE-2011-3389)  It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious input. (CVE-2011-3521)  It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with the full privileges of the JVM. (CVE-2011-3544)  It was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3547)  It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3548)  It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3551)  It was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial of service for other applets or applications running within the same JVM. (CVE-2011-3552)  It was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3553)  It was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted pack200 JAR file. (CVE-2011-3554)  It was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code.

This provides the corresponding OpenJDK 6 update for usewith the ARM (armel) architecture in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10and Ubuntu 11.04.Original advisory details: It was discovered that the Java HttpServer class did not limit the number of headers read from a HTTP request. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by sending special requests that trigger hash collisions predictably. (CVE-2011-5035)  ATTENTION: this update changes previous Java HttpServer class behavior by limiting the number of request headers to 200. This may be increased by adjusting the sun.net.httpserver.maxReqHeaders property.  It was discovered that the Java Sound component did not properly check buffer boundaries. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or view confidential data. (CVE-2011-3563)  It was discovered that the Java2D implementation does not properly check graphics rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

This could potentially result in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted E-Mail, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or steal confidential data within the same domain. (CVE-2012-1956)  Fr?d?ric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

(CVE-2012-3972)  It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data in a Thunderbird extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks to become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3975)  It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to become exploitable. (CVE-2012-3978)  Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a privileged context.

The new packages introducedregressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixesthe problem.Original advisory details: Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-5842, CVE-2012-5843)  Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. (CVE-2012-4202)  It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-4201)  Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2012-5836)  It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of Firefox &quot;new tab&quot; page, the script will inherit the privileges of the privileged &quot;new tab&quot; page. This allows for the execution of locally installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL. (CVE-2012-4203)  Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2012-4204)  Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. (CVE-2012-4205)  Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object properties via a crafted web site. (CVE-2012-4208)  Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-5841)  Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used for text, the &quot;~&quot; character will destroy another character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-4207)  Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-5837)  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's value is set to &quot;top&quot;. This can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (CVE-2012-4209)  Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program. (CVE-2012-4210)  Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (CVE-2012-4214, CVE-2012-4215, CVE-2012-4216, CVE-2012-5829, CVE-2012-5839, CVE-2012-5840, CVE-2012-4212, CVE-2012-4213, CVE-2012-4217, CVE-2012-4218)  Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.
